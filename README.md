## Description

In the midst of a sandstorm, you will watch over a wooden tower, whose beams are decaying over time. Scrub the beams to reverse the decay and collect points by getting nearer to the sun. How high can you build the tower before reaching your limits?

The game has been created as a submission to the Endless Jam 2022 which requires the game to be playable endlessly. The game would run endlessly if the player can prevent any beam to break and thus could create an infinite high tower.

The topic of the jam is Decay. The wooden beams of the tower are decaying continuously.
